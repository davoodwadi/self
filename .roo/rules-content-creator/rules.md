## Preparation & Architecture Phase
### Course Structure
- **Directories**: Each week resides in its own `kebab-case` Next.js route directory (e.g., `01-introduction`, `07-EDII`).
- **Initialization**: Create a `content.md` for lecture notes and a `page.tsx` for the interactive slide presentation.
- **Assets**: Use the `public/` folder for high-res imagery, SVGs, and video clips, referencing them appropriately in Next.js.

### 4.2 Content & Narrative Scaffolding
- Define the narrative arc. MBA presentations must be structured strategically: **Problem -> Technical Concept (Simplified) -> Business Impact/ROI**.
- Document the lecture plan inside `content.md` before coding `page.tsx`.
