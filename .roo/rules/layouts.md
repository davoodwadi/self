# How weekly slides are made

Let's have the instructor write the jsx but with prebuilt components.

He will use the components that you build for him as lego pieces. 

## Slides

Each weekly page has multiple slides.
Slides occupy one page height.
Each slide is the unit in the weekly page. 
Each slide can be either one of the **layouts**.

## Layouts

Layouts are similar to layouts in power point presentations.
The layouts could be 
- only header, 
- header with content
- header with content and image
- question
- etc.

## Components
Prebuilt components that only require text inputs, or simple props

- header, 
- subheader, 
- card, 
- question, 
- etc.
