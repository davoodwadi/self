- You put all the content to discuss during the lecture inside content.md
- Inside the content space each talking point with questions that spark conversations in class
- Avoid generic questions and make them interesting.
- Next, based on the content inside content.md create the page for the slides. 
- Use all of the points inside workflow.md to create a cinematic slide deck.
