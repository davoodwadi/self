## 3. Technology Stack
To achieve infinite customizability and true cinematic effects, we use a bespoke, adaptable web stack rather than standard markdown-to-slide generators:
- **Core**: Next.js (React), lucide-react, tailwindcss.
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Framer Motion**: for animations.
- **Animation Engine**: **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** (with ScrollTrigger) for weighted, high-performance, and complex scroll/timeline animations.
- **3D/Visual Effects**: **Three.js / WebGL** for embedded interactive 3D models or dynamic cinematic backgrounds (parallax particle networks, etc.).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for 1:1 pixel-perfect layouts, typography control, and responsive scaling.
