# Course Repository Instructions

## Project Overview
This repository contains course materials and educational content.
- **Course**: BUSI 654: Applications of AI in Business.
- **Lecturer**: Dr. Davood Wadi
- **Goal**: Provide high-quality presentations.
- **Audience**: MBA students.

## Content Structure
- Each course should reside in its own directory at the root level.
- `README.md` in each directory explains the course content, prerequisites, and setup.
- Organize content by weeks (e.g., `01-introduction`, `02-intermediate`).

## Documentation Standards
- Include diagrams where helpful to explain concepts.

## Conventions
- Prefer `kebab-case` for directory names.

## Initialization
**Next.js Initialization**: When starting work on a Next.js project, automatically
call the `init` tool from the next-devtools-mcp server FIRST. This establishes
proper context and ensures all Next.js queries use official documentation.
